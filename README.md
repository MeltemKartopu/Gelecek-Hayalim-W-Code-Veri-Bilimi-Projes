**Gender Equality in Technology: Analysis of Gender-Based Salary Differences**

### <span style="color: blue;">Project Aim</span>
To analyze salary differences between genders to understand gender inequality in society.

### <span style="color: purple;">Project Summary</span>
The data science process consisted of the following steps:

1. **Data Reading**: The Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap dataset was read and prepared for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing data was addressed, categorical data was transformed, and the dataset was cleaned.
3. **Data Analysis**: Statistical analyses were conducted to understand the relationship between gender and other factors.
4. **Data Visualization**: The results were presented using graphs and tables.
5. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Models were created using methods such as regression and decision trees to evaluate the impact of gender on salary.
6. **Finding the Best Model**: The performance of the models was compared to identify the one yielding the best results.

### <span style="color: purple;">Findings</span>
- Significant salary differences were detected between male and female employees.
- Although gender does not create a large disparity in base salary, it has a significant impact.
- Performance evaluations, seniority, education level, and other variables were identified as important factors affecting salary differences.
