To analyze salary differences between genders to understand gender inequality in society.

### ![Project Summary](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Summary-purple?style=flat-square)
The data science process consisted of the following steps:

1. **Data Reading**: The Glassdoor Gender Pay Gap dataset was read and prepared for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing data was addressed, categorical data was transformed, and the dataset was cleaned.
3. **Data Analysis**: Statistical analyses were conducted to understand the relationship between gender and other factors.
4. **Data Visualization**: The results were presented using graphs and tables.
5. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Models were created using methods such as regression and decision trees to evaluate the impact of gender on salary.
6. **Finding the Best Model**: The performance of the models was compared to identify the one yielding the best results.

### ![Findings](https://img.shields.io/badge/Findings-purple?style=flat-square)
